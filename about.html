        <h1 class="heading">WHY COMPUTER SCIENCE?</h1>
        <p class="text">
            Computer Science is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field at the intersection 
            of technology, mathematics, and problem-solving. It encompasses the study of 
            computers, algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and the principles 
            underlying the design and analysis of software and hardware systems. Computer 
            scientists develop innovative solutions to complex problems, ranging from creating 
            software applications and designing algorithms to understanding the theoretical 
            foundations of computation. The field is diverse, covering areas such as artificial 
            intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, software engineering, and more. 
            In essence, Computer Science empowers individuals to harness the power of technology 
            to create, innovate, and address a wide range of challenges in our increasingly 
            digital world.
